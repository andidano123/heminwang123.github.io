## Welcome to HeMinWang123 GitHub Pages

In the past few years, I have mainly developed software for users in mainland China. This time I plan to break through myself and try to develop world-class software. I personally think that the next development direction of the Internet is Metaverse. NFT and GAMEFI are indispensable. I hope to join your company and participate in this revolution. To be honest, my biggest shortcoming at the moment is that my English ability is not strong enough, but through work in your company and my hard work, I quickly catch up. At present, my salary request is not very high. This does not mean that I am not professional enough, but that I'm sincere, I will always strive to become the most powerful programmer in your company, and then I will ask for a higher salary. I hope your company will give me a chance to do my best in your company.
